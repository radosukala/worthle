# worthle.dev

Know your worth. No signup.

Worthle is a Wordle-style skill assessment for developers. Take a timed quiz, get your skill fingerprint, and see your real market salary range — all in under 5 minutes.

## How it works

1. **Pick your profile** — track, language, experience level
2. **Answer 20 rounds** — code questions with a 12-second timer each
3. **Get your fingerprint** — animated radar chart of your skill categories
4. **See your salary range** — based on your skills, experience, and location

Two modes:

- **Daily Worthle** — 5 rounds, same questions for everyone, track your streak
- **Full Assessment** — 20 rounds, randomized, full salary estimate
